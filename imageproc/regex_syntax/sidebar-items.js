Its canonical format is defined by the following invariants:Given any Unicode scalar value, it is matched by *at most* one character range in a canonical character class. Every adjacent character range is separated by at least one Unicode scalar value. Given any pair of character ranges `r1` and `r2`, if `r1.end < r2.start`, then `r1` comes before `r2` in a canonical character class. In sum, any `CharClass` produced by this crate's parser is a sorted sequence of non-overlapping ranges. This makes it possible to test whether a character is matched by a class with a binary search.If the case insensitive flag was set when parsing a character class, then simple case folding is done automatically. For example, `(?i)[a-c]` is automatically translated to `[a-cA-C]`."],["ClassRange","A single inclusive range in a character class.Since range boundaries are defined by Unicode scalar values, the boundaries can never be in the open interval `(0xD7FF, 0xE000)`. However, a range may *cover* codepoints that are not scalar values.Note that this has a few convenient impls on `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` for testing whether a character is contained inside a given range."],["Error","A parse error.This includes details about the specific type of error and a rough approximation of where it occurred."],["ExprBuilder","A builder for configuring regular expression parsing.This allows setting the default values of flags and other options, such as the maximum nesting depth."]],"type":[["Result","An alias for computations that can return a `Error`."]]});
